# Project Overview
This project uses the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to analyze a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2020. The goal is to classify movies into categories such as genre, success level (box office performance), or ratings based on features like title, director, release Date.

# Dataset
The dataset includes movies from 1980 to 2020, containing features such as:

- Title
- Director
- Genre
- Release Date
- Duration
- Rating
# Project Objectives
- Implement KNN for classifying movies into different categories based on their features.
- Analyze the relationship between movie features and their performance or genre.
- Visualize classification results and model accuracy.
# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the movie dataset.
- KNN model implementation for movie classification.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix.
